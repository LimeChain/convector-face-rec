# frec - barcode

This awesome project was created automatically with <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/convector-cli" target="_blank">Convector CLI</a>.
By default new Convector projects locally include <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/hurley">Hurley</a> to manage your development environment seamlessly, so you don't have to worry about setting up the network and hard ways to install  and upgrade your chaincodes.

You may very well install **Hurley** globally for easier and more flexible management. 

`npm i -g @worldsibu/hurley`

Since with Hurley globally you have control over everything, some things that you can do, for example, is installing a Convector Smart Contract with a different name than the one you used for your project.

```
# Use the same package
# Install a new chaincode with the same source code but the name 'anothernameforyourcc'
hurl install anothernameforyourcc node
```

Other complex tasks you may need is installing to a different channel.

```
# Use the same package
# Be sure you started your environment with more than one channel running 'hurl new --channels 2'. Otherwise this will throw an error.
hurl install anothernameforyourcc node --channel ch2
```

If you don't want to, don't worries! This project works right away.
